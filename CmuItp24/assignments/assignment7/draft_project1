# Fermat Numbers and Coprimality

The definition of Fermat numbers is:
Fₙ = 2^(2^n) + 1

We prove the theorem that for any two distinct Fermat numbers Fₙ and Fₘ
with n ≠ m, their greatest common divisor is 1, meaning they are coprime.

Theorem: If n ≠ m, then Fermat numbers Fₙ and Fₘ are coprime.
That is, gcd(Fₙ, Fₘ) = 1 for n ≠ m.

-- Prove that gcd(F(m), F(n)) = 1 for m ≠ n

-- Assume without loss of generality that m < n.

-- Decompose F(n) - 2 modulo F(m) based on your notes:
-- F(m) divides F(n) - 2, which implies gcd(F(m), F(n)) must divide 2.

-- Since both Fermat numbers are odd (F(n) = 2^(2^n) + 1),
-- their gcd must divide an odd number (i.e., 1 or 3), but only 1 is possible.
-- Now show that the only divisor of 2 common between odd Fermat numbers is 1.
